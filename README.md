# Project Name

### For BL-MSCH-C220 at Indiana University, Bloomington
### April 29, 2020

---

This game was developed as a final project for C220 as part of a 48-hour game jam. 

When we considered the theme of Corona, we thought about it this way:

A Royal tring to recapture his throne

These are the struggles and surprises we encountered as we developed it:

Tilemaps are difficult to work with

These are the technologies and resources we used:

musescore and audacity for the music
Piskel for spriting and animations
Paint.net for minor tweaks 
Godot for Game Engine

This is the objective of the game:

To reach the throne

This is how the game is played:

As a platformer, AVOID the corrupt guards, and reach the throne

Future plans:

Fixing the tilemaps
Adding more levels
adding a story
Bosses?
